### Article
In this [Article](https://www.samirsaci.com/raw-materials-optimization-for-food-manufacturing-with-python/), we will build  a model to 
design an optimal recipe for a meal bar.

#### Problem Statement
As an R&D manager of a large food manufacturer, you need to design a recipe for a new cheap and healthy meal bar.
Meal bars must function as a meal rather than just a snack to fill in the cracks.

#### Scenario
7 ingredients are available
Meat: Chicken, Beef, Mutton
Non-Meat: Rice, Corn, Wheat bran, Peanuts

These ingredients have different nutrition facts (in grams) per gram

</p>

They have also different costs ($/gram)
