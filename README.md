#### Problem Statement
As an R&D manager of a large food manufacturer, you need to design a recipe for a new cheap and healthy meal bar.
Meal bars must function as a meal rather than just a snack to fill in the cracks.

#### Scenario
7 ingredients are available
Meat: Chicken, Beef, Mutton
Non-Meat: Rice, Corn, Wheat bran, Peanuts

These ingredients have different nutrition facts (in grams) per gram
